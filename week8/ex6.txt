Given:
- 16-bit virtual addresses
- 8 KB page size
- single-level linear page table
Find:
- entries number - ?
Solution:
Since page has size 8 KB, then we need an offset of size which makes possible to access any byte inside page. Number of
bytes inside page 8 * 2^10 = 2^13. So we need offset of size 13 bits. Hence, in virtual address left 16 - 13 = 3 bits
for pages indexing. 3 bits is sufficient to support at most 2^3 = 8 page entries.
Answer:
8 entries are needed for a single-level linear page table.
